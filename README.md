# Social-Network-Analysis-Terror-Affiliation
Social Network Analysis project made with Python: pandas, networkx, matplotlib and more

In this project, our team will be using a dataset of terrorists involved in the 9/11 bombing of the World Trade Centres in 2001. The dataset was extracted from news reports, and the ties consist of relations such as “at school with” to “on the same plane.” The ties are undirected and they are binary. 

The data was then compressed into an XML file, which we will clean up so that the XML file will only include target and source. To carry out this clean up by hand, we created the csv file with the find/replace functions out of the XML file. When we have our csv file, python and jupyter notebook, with specific libraries such as pandas to read the data and display information for our network analysis. We will also use networkx to graph the data and create visuals so that we can have a view of the network. Once we have generated the graph, we will add more calculations of specific characteristics of the graph, such as centralities, shortest paths, and the most influential nodes. 

Technologies used: networkx, pandas, jupyter notebook, python, matplotlib
